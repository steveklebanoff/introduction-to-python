# Why use it?
* "Pythonic" way of doing things extremely readable, easy to understand, "elegant", "clean"
* Readability and quality of code much higher standard than PHP
* Great documentation and community, consistent and clear naming standards (PHP: isset, is_array, isPublic, wtf?)
* Large amount of libraries
* Concentrate on the problem, not on the syntax
* Portable, Extensible
